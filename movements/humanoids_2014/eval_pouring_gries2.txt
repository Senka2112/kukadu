--> todo:
- maybe change m(1,1) to 0.00075 or 0.0008?
- other query points to compare with nearest neighbour
- video!!!
- improve paper
- test if trajectories on right side are correct (maybe also remove one or another from database)
- maybe reinforce single policies when around it samples delivered bad reward?
